//Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

//A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the
//characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).



//Example 1:

//Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
//Output: true

//Example 2:

//Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
//Output: false




//Constraints:

//0 <= s.length <= 100
//    0 <= t.length <= 104
//    s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.


//Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109,
//and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Console.WriteLine(IsSubsequence("axc", "ahbgdc"));

static bool IsSubsequence(string s, string t)
{
    int sPointer = 0;
    int tPointer = 0;
